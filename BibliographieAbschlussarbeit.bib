  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys recent developments in the theory of bidding mechanisms and discusses the relevance of the theoretical results for auctions in practice. An auction is a market institution with an explicit set of rules determining resource allocation and prices on the basis of bids from the market participants. Sometimes there is a single buyer who wishes to purchase some item from one of a set of potential suppliers. From a theoretical point of view, monopsony is essentially the same as monopoly apart from reversal of the signs of some variables. Governments are the most prominent users of procurement auctions. In a modern market economy, the government's purchases from private firms typically account for about 10 percent of gross domestic product. For many government contracts, firms submit sealed bids, the contract is required by law to be awarded to the lowest qualified bidder. Sealed-bid tenders are sometimes also used by firms procuring inputs from other firms. Novel uses of auctions include the auctioning of the rights to a natural monopoly as a substitute for regulating it.},
