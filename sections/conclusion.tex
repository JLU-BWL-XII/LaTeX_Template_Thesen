\section{Conclusions}\label{chap:conclusions}
A brief conclusion does not require any further subdivision. In this case, the chapter title should read as follows: "Summary and conclusion".

\subsection{Summary}

The summary of the work is optional. If you want to summarize the work again, please keep it rather short and do not repeat yourself too much.
\subsection{Limitations and Future Research}
It makes sense to link each limitation to an idea of how it could be addressed in future work.
\subsection{Contribution}
What are the contributions of your work to both science (and theory) and practice? Here you should try to think outside the box and take a rather broad view.
