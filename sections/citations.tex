\subsection{Citing Literature}
We recommend using reference management programs like Zotero, Citavi, or Mendeley:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manage PDF documents
    \item Automatic import of source information via plug-ins in the browser, PDF, databases, etc.
    \item Annotations, notes, tagging, ...
    \item Comparison of the software: \url{https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1316333/1316333.pdf}
    \item These programs cannot do magic; check if the stored information is correct! This is your responsibility!
    \item Garbage in \( \rightarrow \) Garbage out
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Citation Style}
\begin{itemize}
    \item American Psychological Association (APA) \( \geq \) 6 Citation style
    \item Please view very good instructions online: \url{https://www.scribbr.de/category/apa-standard/}
    \item Both direct quotations (adopted passages in the wording) and indirect quotations (adoption of an idea) must be identified.
    \item Each source used in the paper (book, article in a collective work, journal article, website (with retrieval date)) must be referenced!
    \item In most cases, there is a publication behind a website, e.g.: behind \url{https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/artificial-intelligence-in-business-gets-real/} hides the following source: \textcite{ransbotham2018}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indirect Citation (In-text citation)}
Parenthetical: There is a correlation between social media usage and anxiety symptoms in teenagers \parencite{barr1999}.

Narrative: \textcite{barr1999} found a correlation between social media usage and anxiety symptoms in teenagers.

\textbf{One Author:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An early study of this phenomenon\parencite{barr1999}...
    \item \textcite{barr1999} already dealt with this phenomenon...
    \item  Already in 1999 Barr dealt with this special phenomenon...

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Two Authors:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \parencite{cadogan2013}
    \item But: Already \textcite{cadogan2013} dealt with this special phenomenon.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Three or More Authors:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item generally only ever cite the first author and then with et al.
    \item Example: \parencite{beutel2004}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Using multiple sources:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The various sources are separated by a semicolon and sorted alphabetically
    \item Example: \parencite{barr1999, cadogan2013, smith2015, smith2017}.
\end{itemize}

If you cannot find the original source, you should cite it through the secondary source using “as cited in”: \parencite[as cited in Parker, 2021]{smith2017}.

\subsection{Direct Quotes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literal quotations must be reproduced verbatim and placed between quotation marks!
    \item Example: APA direct quote According to a recent paper, “quotes can be useful in academic writing” \parencite[p. 25]{singh2019}.
    \item Three If the quote is 40 words or more, format it as a block quote: \begin{quote}
        Lawmakers and regulators must stop pharmaceutical companies from marketing drugs such as OxyContin and establish stronger guidelines on how and when doctors can prescribe them. These drugs are often the last resort for people with cancer and other terminal conditions who experience intense pain. But they pose a great risk when used to treat the kinds of pain for which there are numerous non-addictive therapies available. \parencite{editorialboard2018}.
    \end{quote}
    \item  If you only want to quote an excerpt directly, you can use [...] to indicate that you have left something out. It is
important to note that this does not change the content of the quoted text.
    
    '[...] it is possible that participants fewer attended effectiveness ratings for charities because they wanted to have agency when making charitable
decisions [...' \parencite[p. 827]{ransbotham2018}.

\end{enumerate}
