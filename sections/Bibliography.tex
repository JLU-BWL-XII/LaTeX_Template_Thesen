\section{Bibliography}


\subsection{Basics}
List all materials used. Sort alphabetically by the author's name (within an author, chronologically, with the oldest source first). Use indents. Do not sort by source type. Do not use bullet points.


\subsection{DOI or URL}
Works that can be accessed online usually have a URL or DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is often used for scientific publications and books, while a URL is more common for other online publications.

Use the following guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If available, always add a DOI.
    \item A DOI is preferred over a URL (because it never changes).
    \item Include the protocol (\texttt{http://} or \texttt{https://}) for both DOIs and URLs.
    \item Do not add a period after the DOI or URL.
\end{itemize}
